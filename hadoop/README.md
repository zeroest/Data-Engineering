The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage.

Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

## [Here's what makes Hadoop especially useful](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/tags/release-0.15.1/docs/index.html)

1. Scalable: Hadoop can reliably store and process petabytes.
2. Economical: It distributes the data and processing across clusters of commonly available computers. These clusters can number into the thousands of nodes.
3. Efficient: By distributing the data, Hadoop can process it in parallel on the nodes where the data is located. This makes it extremely rapid.
4. Reliable: Hadoop automatically maintains multiple copies of data and automatically redeploys computing tasks based on failures.
